# Extend the api client
To extend the api client look at the [openapi.json](https://docs.discourse.org/openapi.json) 
or look at the official [api-repository](https://github.com/discourse/discourse_api) on Github.com to find out much more not documented in the openapi.json

The [wbdiscourseAPI-functions.py.txt](./wbdiscourseAPI-functions.py.txt) contains possible python functions for the [wbdiscourse.py](./wbdiscourse.py).
You can copy the functions below the related **#regions-tag** and paste them below the **region-tag** in the [wbdiscourse.py](./wbdiscourse.py)
